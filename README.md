Users create profiles which determine when the application will mute unwanted notifcations. 
* To create a profile, click on the '+' icon in the top right of the main screen. 
* Select days of the week and times of the day in which you want this profile to mute notifications. 
* Select contacts from which you do want to recieve notifications from. 
* Lastly, check if you want to receive phone calls and/or texts from these selected contacts.

In the main menu screen, the user is able to view all profiles created and is able to edit or delete them by clicking on the profile.

Users can also 'turn off' profiles from the main menu screen if they don't want that profile active at all by clicking the checkbox next to the profile.
